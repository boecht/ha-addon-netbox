configuration:
  reset_superuser:
    name: Reset admin credentials
    description: >
      Create or reset the NetBox admin user to admin/admin on next start. Turn off again after you log in to avoid
      locking out your production account.
  allowed_hosts:
    name: Allowed hosts
    description: >
      Hosts allowed to reach NetBox (comma-separated hostnames, IPs, or wildcards, e.g. homeassistant.local,
      192.168.1.10, *.example.com). CIDR ranges like 10.3.2.0/24 are not supported. Set * to allow any host on your LAN,
      but prefer explicit hostnames for better security.
  housekeeping_interval:
    name: Housekeeping interval
    description: >
      Seconds between NetBox housekeeping jobs (default 3600). Lower values keep the database tidier but increase load.
  enable_prometheus:
    name: Enable Prometheus metrics
    description: >
      Expose NetBox metrics at /metrics for scraping. Disable if you do not scrape metrics to minimize attack surface.
  debug_logging:
    name: Debug logging
    description: >
      Emit verbose DEBUG logs from the embedded supervisor script. Leave enabled while troubleshooting. Turn off to reduce
      noise in the Supervisor log.
  plugins:
    name: NetBox plugins
    description: >
      Comma-separated plugin module names to enable (e.g. netbox_topology_views, netbox_dns). Bundled choices:
      netbox_topology_views, netbox_dns, netbox_ping. The listed modules are pre-installed; any others must already be in
      your custom image. Restart the add-on after changing this list. Leave blank to disable all.
network:
  8080/tcp: NetBox web UI (maps to add-on port 8000)
